# Enhancing my Spotify Playlists with Machine Learning: 
## After completing the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Specialization courses from [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) I wanted to implement a tool that has direct results in my everyday life and potentially others.
### this reposity is an implemnentation and eventual deployment for a Unsupervised learning algorithm that will cluster Spotify songs into playlists. Afterweards I intend to create a recommender system that will continually recommend me new music that I can add to these playlists via content-based filtering
### eventually I want to deploy this program likely using flask to provide the potentially for other people to do the same 
### The motivation for this is two fold in practicing my Machine/Deep Learnign skills and also organizing my thousand song playlist of 'liked songs' into multiple sub playlists and furthermore recommending new songs to add to the playlists
