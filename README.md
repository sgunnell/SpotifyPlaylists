Unsupervised learning project to classify your Spotify liked songs into multiple playlists and recommend new songs using a content-based filtering recommender system. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to categorize your songs and provide personalized recommendations based on your music preferences.

After completing the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Specialization courses from [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) I wanted to implement a tool that has direct results in my everyday life and potentially others. The motivation for this is two fold in practicing my Machine/Deep Learnign skills and also organizing my thousand song playlist of 'liked songs' into multiple sub playlists and furthermore recommending new songs to add to the playlists.
